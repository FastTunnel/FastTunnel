## What is FastTunnel？
- FastTunnel is a high-performance cross-platform intranet penetration tool. With it, you can expose intranet services to the public network for yourself or anyone to access.
- Unlike other penetration tools, the FastTunnel project is committed to creating an easy-to-extensible and easy-to-maintain intranet penetration framework.
- You can build your own penetration application by referencing the nuget package of `FastTunnel.Core`, and target the business extension functions you need.
